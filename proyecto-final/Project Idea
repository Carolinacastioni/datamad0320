## Titulo proyecto 

What's My Age Again?

## Descripción de proyecto 

Age detection in picture or in real-time video using image recognition.


## modulos pyhton, APIs, tecnologias, links de referencia


Dataset: Audience dataset: https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html

other dataset: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/

I already requested access for the dataset, because is not public. 

The Adience dataset has 8 classes divided into the following age groups [(0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100)]


Modulos:

- OpenCV
- Deep learning
- tensorflow
- keras
- caffemodel
- pytorch
- Face detection: DNN, Haar cascades, HOG + Linear SVM, Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), etc.
- For the video: imutils.video


Steps:

- Detect faces.
- Apply the age detector algorithm to predict the age.

## Questions: 

- I also have the option to do gender and age. Should I do both? 

- Do I need to train the dataset? In order to get the age detector algorithm.

- The dataset is only photos for what I was able to see. Does it work?

- Ideal plan: See if a person is lying by micro facial expression. Couldn't find any dataset :(

## PLAN B:

- Create Face ID. 
- Convert voice into text.
